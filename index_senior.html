<font size="5">Intro:</font>

<br>

I'm a senior at <a href="http://www.vwc.edu"target="_blank">Virginia Wesleyan College.</a>

<br>

I'm a Computer Science major with a Studio Art minor and am interested in the technology industry.

<br>
<br>

I have many interests including anime and video games.

<br>

One of my most favorite anime of all time is <a href="Geass.htm"target="_blank">Code:  Geass</a>.

<br>

This show has everything and is a must see for any anime fan.

<br>

It is able to tell a unique story that will keep the viewer

<br>

guessing.

<br>
<br>
As for my interest in Video Games I thought that I would highlight a major figure in the Video Game Industry.

<br>
