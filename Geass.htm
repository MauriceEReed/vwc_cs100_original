Lelouch Lamperouge is the protagonist of Code Geass. He is originally born as Lelouch vi Britannia, the Eleventh Prince of the Britannian Imperial Family and seventeenth in line for the throne. His father is the Britannian Emperor, Charles zi Britannia, and his mother was Marianne vi Britannia. For questioning his father's cold apathy of his mother's assassination and his sister Nunnally's disablement, Lelouch and Nunnally were sent to Japan as political hostages. Taken into the residence of the Prime Minister of Japan, Lelouch and Nunnally soon formed a strong friendship with the Prime Minister's son, Suzaku Kururugi. When Britannia invaded Japan, he went into hiding with his sister, taking refuge with the Ashford family. Seven years later, he discovers a girl known as C.C., who grants Geass, an ability that allows him to command any person to follow his subsequent order. Seeking to build a peaceful world for his sister, he pursues the destruction of Britannia under the guise of his masked alter-ego, Zero. As Zero, he creates a military force known as the Black Knights, formed from the members of a group originally known as the Japanese Resistance. Although Lelouch serves as a brilliant strategist in the organization he created, he is oblivious to his admirers.

Clovis la Britannia is the Third Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and former Viceroy of Area 11. He is timid and narcissistic, as well as unaccustomed to failure. He and Lelouch would often play chess during their childhood; despite consistently losing, Clovis viewed Lelouch as a friendly rival. Clovis was apparently involved in the research on C.C. and others like her, and he feared that his involvement might get him disowned were it made public. When C.C.'s capsule is stolen by Japanese resistance fighters under the mistaken belief that it contains poison gas, Clovis is quick to order the eradication of the Shinjuku ghetto to disguise his secret project. Once Lelouch is given the power of Geass, he organizes the resistance to defeat Clovis's forces and confront his brother, killing him after extracting what little information Clovis has about his mother's death.

Though she is decisive and straightforward in most situations, she has a soft spot for her sister Euphemia, such that she prioritizes Euphemia's safety over the completion of her objectives.
